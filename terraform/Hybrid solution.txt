create a Hybrid solution

I want to create a s2S tunnel with an Azure firewall inspecting to and from the remote site

>> I am using the same Resourrce group and Location to simplify things

>> The Firewall and the VPN Gateway will reside in the same Vnet

>> A VPN Gateway will be deployed in a remote Vnet

>> A Spoke Vnet will be dployed which will be peered with the Hub Vnet and "the use remote Gateway" feature enabled

>> A route table will be added to the Gatewaysubnet forcing all traffic destined to the spoke Vnet via the Firewall

>> A route table will also be added to the subnet of choice in the spoke vnet forcing all traffic destined to the Hub network* and remote network and internet via the firewall

>> Three Virtual machines will be created across all Vnets accordingly and they will have the same NSG applied

>> The Spoke VM should have no Public ip - we will be using the Firewall to RDP into it

>> Network and Dnat rules will be configured on the Azure Firewall 

>> The corresponding LNGs and Conenctions will be configured to create the Tunnel





A VPN S2S 

A firewall 

Three VMs located in three Vnets


Vnet A (Remote) 172.19.0.0/16

Vnet B (Hub Vnet) 100.10.0.0/16

Vnet C (Spoke Vnet) 100.20.0.0/16

A VPN Gateway and a Firewall deployed in the Hub Vnet

A route table associated to the Spoke VM subnet 

6 subnets

Remote Vnet

172.19.0.0/24 - VM Subnet
172.19.1.0/25 - GW Subnet

Hub Vnet 

100.10.0.0/24 - VM Subnet
100.10.1.0/25 - FW Subnet
100.10.2.0/26 - GW Subnet

Spoke Vnet

100.20.0.0/24 - VM Subnet
